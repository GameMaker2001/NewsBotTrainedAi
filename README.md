# NewsBotTrainedAi
Data Wrangling project focusing on cleaning, structuring, preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction to any multi class classification and semantic analysis of specifically BBC News articles for media monitoring insights

The goal was to take the provided template and improve/streamline the code given. On top of that retrofit it for specific use using the BBC Data.  The vision was even though the program was relativly simple was to not consider it just a standard article classifier. For instance, a media company could use our Sentiment Module (M6) to compare their competitors' editorial tone against their own, or leverage the Named Entity Recognition (NER) module (M8) to track the frequency of specific organizations and people over time.
